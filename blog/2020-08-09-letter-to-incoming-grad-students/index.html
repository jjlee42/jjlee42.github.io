<p><strong>Meta advice: don’t take anyone’s advice too seriously</strong></p>

<p>Really the most useful I want to impart is to not to take any advice, comment, or what-have-you as prescriptive, including this sentence. One of the biggest contributions to insecurities early in my PhD was taking people’s advice and off-hand comments too seriously. So, relax.</p>

<p>From my own experience giving advice, people will either tell you to do what they did (if it worked out for them) or the opposite of what they did (if it didn’t work out for them). Also, people can have an imperfect memory or interpretation of their experiences, so advice generated on this basis can be flawed. In the end this kind of approach tries to mold you, even with the best of intentions, to be an all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful Super Person that really probably doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>Taking any one person&rsquo;s experiences to heart might not work out for you, because you are your own distinct person with a personality, working style, and background that is different to the advice-giver.</p>

<p>Which brings me to&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="on-setting-yourself-up-for-the-perfect-phd">On setting yourself up for the perfect PhD</h3>

<p>You really, really can’t prepare for everything. It’s natural as a high-achiever, of which you probably are one if you&rsquo;re doing a PhD, to want to be the Most Prepared. However, mistakes happen, not least because research is about pushing unknowns. It’s not healthy to try to set up yourself for a bump-free PhD (or life). At some point in your life, you&rsquo;re bound to run into a situation that you didn&rsquo;t predict, like a worldwide pandemic. It&rsquo;s a much better strategy therefore to <em>learn to learn from</em> setbacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Make mistakes, just don’t make the same mistake twice.”<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>“Either you win or you learn”. <em><a href="https://researchtopracticeconnections.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/lessons-learned-from-sport-how-not-to-suck-in-graduate-school/">&ndash; Lessons Learned from Sport: How Not to Suck in Graduate School</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a grad student, you are called a trainee for a reason. Cliché as it sounds, the grad school experience is really your time to grow. (This also means that it&rsquo;s not too late. You might feel chained to your undergrad degree or past research experience, but you are actually still <em>very</em> early in your career. In fact, did you know that many academics even much later have changes in direction, either intentionally or due to circumstance?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>)</p>

<h3 id="on-not-getting-the-material">On not &ldquo;getting&rdquo; the material</h3>

<p>There is much to learn as a grad student, and part of the process is gaining confidence in having and addressing knowledge gaps. When you don&rsquo;t understand a talk or a paper, it&rsquo;s easy to attribute that to being due to not being &ldquo;smart&rdquo; enough to understand it. Instead, you just might not have the right background knowledge <em>yet</em>. But there&rsquo;s one more possibility: sometimes, it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s them.</p>

<p>Early in my PhD, I witnessed faculty I respected being honest in expressing when they didn&rsquo;t understand something. Seeing this was a revelation: if I didn’t &ldquo;get it&rdquo;, it might be that the speaker or author just didn’t explain it well. Scientists are rarely explicitly trained to be good writers or presenters, and both are difficult arts. Even further, the experiments or analyses themselves may not make sense, and that might be because they <em>just don&rsquo;t make sense</em>. Research is a process, conducted by imperfect beings, and sometimes the result is something imperfect too. Especially early in grad school, my favorite part of a seminar was the question session. What did other people think? What points did they disagree on, or not understand?</p>

<p>An important related point is that the so-called &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; of the journal is not a perfect indicator of the quality of the work. As a new grad student attending journal clubs, I saw papers in &ldquo;glam&rdquo; journals being critiqued. This was another revelation, that just because a paper got into a &ldquo;good&rdquo; journal, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the work is flawless. Sometimes I like to look at the reviews of journals which publicize their reviews (eLife by default, and some papers in Nature Communications). Doing so can help calibrate your expectations on the merits and criticisms of the work.</p>

<h3 id="on-having-it-all-figured-out">On having it all figured out</h3>

<p>Lastly, it’s a misconception that everyone has figured out what exactly they want to do in their research by the time they get to grad school, and it’s an even bigger misconception that everyone <em>must</em> figure out what exactly they want to do before getting there.</p>

<p>In fact, I see in fellow grad students equally people who did and didn’t know what they wanted to do, or did know but changed their minds, and everyone turned out as fine as each other. Pretty much everyone I know who did a rotation-based PhD changed the lab or type of work they expected to do at the start of their PhD, myself included.</p>

<p>Going further, if you look at academics&rsquo; stories, such as those from the <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/growingupinscience/unofficial.html">Growing Up In Science series</a>, many academics have deviations in their research paths, which implies that regardless of whether or not they <em>thought</em> they knew what to do, it didn&rsquo;t go as planned.</p>
